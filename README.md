# Online-Examination-System
The Online Examination System is a web-based platform that enables conducting exams digitally in a secure and efficient manner. It allows administrators to create, manage, and schedule tests while providing students with a user-friendly interface to attempt multiple-choice or descriptive questions. The system includes features such as user authentication, automatic grading, timer management, and result generation. It minimizes manual effort, reduces paper usage, and ensures transparency in evaluation. This project is highly useful for educational institutions and corporate training programs to conduct assessments remotely.
